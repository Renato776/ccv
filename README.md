# CCV portal - Canary Release
This repo contains the public web portal 
of the CCV system. However, this version is not official
as it is used primarily for testing and debugging purposes.
The official, curated web portal can be found in: <br>
https://usac-ccv.gitlab.io/portal
<br>
Instead, feel free to use this version if you are interested
in the latest changes, regardless of stability.
As this version is expected to break and get fixed quite often.
<br>
If you find any bug, please submit an issue and we'll fix it 
as soon as possible!
<br>
Finally, you can access this version of the CCV system here:
